# Sprocket Exchange
This App is built using MEAN Stack. It is a simple interface to buy and sell sprockets.
polling has been implemented
Proper use of state providers and routing has been implemented
Promises has been implemented for rest calls.
App can be viewed here http://sprocket-exchange.herokuapp.com/ but the app was deployed without mongodb.
so the service calls have been mocked.
